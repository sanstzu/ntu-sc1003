# SC1003 - Introduction to Programming and Computational Thinking
This repository contains my solutions for the SC1003 module that I took in AY 2022/23 Semester 1. 
Currently, only the C programming part are uploaded for laboratory, tutorial and exercise (to be added soon). Will upload the Python part (lab) soon.
